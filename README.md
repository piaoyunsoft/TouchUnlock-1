TouchUnlock
===========

TouchUnlock lets you unlock your phone using touchID when you don't have a passcode enabled. I personally don't use a passcode on my phone, but I like how quickly and easily touchID lets you unlock your phone, so this tweak gives me the best of both worlds. I think you have to have at least one finger registered for touchID before this tweak will work (but you don't have to have a passcode or touchID turned on in settings (that's the point of this tweak)). Unsure if it conflicts with other touchID tweaks, hopefully not.
